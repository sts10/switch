## Rules

One Player game called Switch! The game is played on a one-dimensional board 9 units long, placed either horizontally or vertically. (Let's assume it is horizontal for the rest of this description.)

The game starts with four red tokens and four blue tokens grouped together on the left and right side of the board, respectively. The 9th space on the board (the middle space) starts off empty.

Each turn, the player can move any one token to an unoccupied adjacent space or jump over exactly one token(of either color) to land on an unoccupied space.

Game Objective: Switch the pieces so that the blue tokens all end up on the left side of the board and the red tokens are on the right, with the middle square again empty. Do it in the shortest amount of time and shortest number of moves possible!
